Application Description:
Green Thumb is a home gardening application designed to assist home gardeners with tracking and finding new plants for their garden. Users are able to search for plants using filters such as height, cycle, hardiness, sunlight, watering, flowers, and edible to find the best plants to match their garden. Users can then view all of these plants' attributes in a more detailed view, and add plants to their garden. Users can also view their garden, as well as get recommendations for new plants based on user-specified location attributes. This application is powered by data from the Perenual API, more information can be found at perenual.com.
